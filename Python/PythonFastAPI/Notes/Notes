- use to make highly standard robust and scalable API can be created

- This is a framework


- What is an API?
    APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components- such as the frontend
    and backend of an application- to communicate with each other using a defined
    set of rules, protocols, and data formats

- When frontend and backend are written in same folder then that architecture is called monolithic architecture.
        Here the biggest drawback is the application is tightly coupled
                Means any change in any part will affect the whole application

- FastAPI os a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python

- FastAPI is build upon Starlette and Pydantic
    starlette -> it is that component of FASTAPI which handle the request and response
    pydantic -> It is a data validation lib, checks if the data coming into your API is correct and in the right format.

- Why fastAPI?
    - It is more better in performance means the response time become fast
    - It is easy and fast to code (earlier there were many unnecessary and boiler plate code which is need to be written)

- SGI -> Server Gateway Interface

- Gunicorn(The web server used in flask) is a WSGI HTTP server, specifically designed for Python web application

- Uvicorn is the webserver used in fastAPI
        ASGI(Asynchronous server gateway interface) is another gatway interface used in fastAPI
        The biggest feature that ASGI have is it can do concurrent processing, means can handle multiple request at a time
        To implement ASGI, starlette is the lib used
        This have the feature of async and await of python

- You can give the analogy of waiter in restaurants

- Why fastAPI is fast to code
    Automatic input validation -> this feature comes from pydantic
    Auto Generated Interactive Documentation
    Seamless Integration with modern Ecosystem(ML/DL, JWT, docker etc)


- HTTP Methods ->
            Software
               /\
              /  \
             /    \
            /      \
        static    dynamic

        static software means user won't interact much with it, mostly these software are used to receive information's
            Ex -> Calender
        dynamic software have much more interaction of user, 2 way communication is also possible
            Ex -> Ms Excel

            Website
               /\
              /  \
             /    \
            /      \
        static    dynamic
        static website won't interact much with client much. Ex -> blog, govt website
        dynamic website interact too much by client. Ex -> insta, facebook

                    Http
                  protocol
        Client <-----------> Server
        GET -> wants to retrieve some info
        POST -> wants to make create interaction
        PUT -> update interaction
        DELETE -> to perform delete interaction



- Path Params
        Path Parameters are dynamic segments of a URL path used to identify a specific resource


- Path
    The Path() function in FastAPI is used to provide metadata, validation, rules, and documentation hints for path parameters in your API endpoints
    Title
    Description
    Example
    ge, gt, le, lt
    Min_length
    Max_length
    regex

- HTTP status code
    These are the 3 digit number returned by a web server(like FastAPI) to indicate the result of a client's request
    Whenever the server return the response then it add HTTP status code also
    These number tell what happen with the request the client sent

    Types of status code
        2XX -> success -> the request was successfully received and processed
        3XX -> Redirection -> Further action needs to be taken (e.g. redirect)
        4XX -> Client Error -> Something is wrong with the request from the client
        5XX -> Server Error -> something went wrong on the server side


    Status code
        200                             -> standard success
        201 Created                     -> Resource Created
        204 No Content                  -> Success but no data returned
        400 Bad Request                 -> Malformed or invalid request
        401 Unauthorized                -> No/invalid authentication
        403 Forbidden                   -> Authenticated but no permission
        404 Not Found                   -> Resource doesn't exist
        500 Internal Server Error       -> Generic failure
        502 Bad Gateway                 -> Gateway(like Nginx) failed to reach backend
        503 Service Unavailable         -> server is down or overloaded


- HTTPException is a special built-in-exception in FastAPI used to return custom HTTP error responses
  when something goes wrong in your API
        Instead of returning a normal JSON or crashing the server, you can gracefully raise an error with
            a proper HTTP status code (like 404, 400, 403, etc)
            a custom error message
            (optional) extra headers

- From now whenever there is an exception instead of returning a normal JSON
  we can raise Exception


- Query Parameters
    These are optional key-value pairs appended tot he end od a URL, used to pass additional
    data to the server in an HTTP request. They are typically employed for operations like filtering, sorting,
    searching and pagination, without altering the endpoint path itself

    THe ? marks the start of query parameter
    Each parameters is a key-value pair:key=value
    multiple parameters are separated by &

- Chronologically means showing something the way it is present

- Query() function
    Is a utility function provided by FastAPI to declare, validate, and document query parameters in your API endpoints

    It allows you to:
        set default values
        Enforce validation rules
        Add metadata like description, title, examples

    default                 -> Set default value(eg:Query(0))
    title                   -> Displayed in API docs
    description             -> Detailed explanation in Swagger
    example/ examples       -> Provide sample inputs
    min_length, max_length  -> validation string length
    ge, gt, le, lt          -> validation numeric bounds
    regex                   -> Pattern match for strings



- pydantic
    its a lib with the help of which data validations are performed

- why pydantic?
    1. Type hint in python is just a hint if you pass string at place of int it will give no error bcz in python type validation is not strong
        pydantic gives the type validation at production level
    2. data validation

- pydantic works in three stages:
    1. define a pydantic model(class) that represents the ideal schema of the data
        - This include the expected fields, their types, and any validation constraints(eg:gt=0 for positive numbers)
    2. Instantiate the model with raw input data(usually a dictionary or JSON-like structure)
        - pydantic will automatically validate the data ans coerce it into the correct python types (if possible)
        - if the data doesn't meet the model's requirements, pydantic raise a ValidationError
    3. Pass the validated model object to functions or use it throughout your codebase
        - This ensure every part of your program works with clean type-safe, and logically valid data.

- pydantic v2 is written in rust, and it works faster behind the scene

- Request body
    is the portion of an HTTP request that contains data sent by the client to the server.
    It is typically used in HTTP methods such as POST, or PUT to transmit structured data(eg JSON, XML, form-data) for
        the purpose of creating or updating resources on the server.
    The server parses the request body to extract the necessary and information and perform the intended operation.

- Response Model
    In fastAPI, a response model defines the structure of the data that your API endpoint will return. It helps in:
        1. Generating clean API
        2. Validating output (to your API doesn't return malformed responses)
        3. Filtering unnecessary data from the response.


- What is Docker?
    Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run container applications.

Lets analog it with maggie
    maggie have two components maggie and masala
    doesn't matter where you are making it the maggie going to taste the same everywhere
        let suppose instead of giving maggie masala they gave you the recipe of it, will that going to taste the same?
        NO, right?
    so they made a standard masala container and make the taste same every time

    So in the same way software face the issue
    you made a project and at the time of testing system changes that may create some issue
    due to the change in OS, change in the lib version and same issue can happen at the time of deployment also

    There was a very need to Standardise it
    So here docker comes into picture

    so at the time of development only, lock the project in a container and for deployment or for testing
    instead of sharing project files we share the container which contains all the necessary requirements respect to project


- Why do we need Dockers?
    Problem - Application often behave differently in development, testing and production environment
              due to variations in configuration, dependencies, and infrastructure
    Solution - Docker containers encapsulate all the necessary components, ensuring the application
                runs consistently across all env

    Problem - Running multiple applications on the same host can lead to conflicts, such as
              dependency clashes or resources contention.
    Solution -  Docker provides isolated environments for each applications, preventing
                interference and ensuring stable performance.

    Problem - Scaling applications to handle increased load can be challenging, requiring manual intervention
              and configuration.
    Solution - Docker makes it east to scale applications horizontally by running multiple container instances,
               allowing for quick and efficient scaling.


Docker Engine
    Docker Engine is the core component of the Docker platform, responsible for creating,
    running and managing Docker containers. It serves as the runtime that powers Docker's
    containerization capabilities. Here's am in-depth look at the Docker Engine
