- use to make highly standard robust and scalable API can be created

- This is a framework


- What is an API?
    APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components- such as the frontend
    and backend of an application- to communicate with each other using a defined
    set of rules, protocols, and data formats

- When frontend and backend are written in same folder then that architecture is called monolithic architecture.
        Here the biggest drawback is the application is tightly coupled
                Means any change in any part will affect the whole application

- FastAPI os a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python

- FastAPI is build upon Starlette and Pydantic
    starlette -> it is that component of FASTAPI which handle the request and response
    pydantic -> It is a data validation lib, checks if the data coming into your API is correct and in the right format.

- Why fastAPI?
    - It is more better in performance means the response time become fast
    - It is easy and fast to code (earlier there were many unnecessary and boiler plate code which is need to be written)

- SGI -> Server Gateway Interface

- Gunicorn(The web server used in flask) is a WSGI HTTP server, specifically designed for Python web application

- Uvicorn is the webserver used in fastAPI
        ASGI(Asynchronous server gateway interface) is another gatway interface used in fastAPI
        The biggest feature that ASGI have is it can do concurrent processing, means can handle multiple request at a time
        To implement ASGI, starlette is the lib used
        This have the feature of async and await of python

- You can give the analogy of waiter in restaurants

- Why fastAPI is fast to code
    Automatic input validation -> this feature comes from pydantic
    Auto Generated Interactive Documentation
    Seamless Integration with modern Ecosystem(ML/DL, JWT, docker etc)
